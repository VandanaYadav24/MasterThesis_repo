282,22,5,Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing I read one review that did not understand why this hotel had such good ratings Well he must be used to spending  per night for a hotel room or never traveled to Hawaii Hotels with this location are often  per night The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel Well unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale Arizona if you have been there I had only worked there and got the view the rooms as I could not afford to spend  per night So when the rates are higher and in line with the majority of the other hotels that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous People pay for gorgeous They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seenWe actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window I would recommend spending the extra  or so per night for the ocean view So it was not fancy but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money The bed was comfortable the ocean breeze was to die for and we could not have asked for more in that price range I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a crossbreeze of ocean airHowever what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff We were treated like family from the moment we arrived We never felt so cared for in a hotel The friendly caring and attentive staff made it a  star hotel in our eyes We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled If you have the extra money get an amazing remodeled room you will not be dissappointed,-6.353462,2.8334572,1.7064874,3.504348,0.40603036,-0.51271474

285,22,5,The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki My fiance and I have made  trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower HotelLeonor in particular and as mentioned by numerous reviews here made us feel more at home than at homeAlso as mentioned by previous reviewers the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms The renovations were not felt or noticed by us there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay  We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated  star quality tile floors Asian influenced decor new furnishings state of the art TV and projectors lighting top of the line bathroom fixtures Once available by end of the year we were told I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new roomsEveryday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs,-5.292309,1.8808012,0.5757899,2.7994273,0.07415933,-0.29769874
286,22,5,Everything positive youve read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki Normally getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip it is really easy to get to from the H by taking the King Street Exit Anyway the hotel is smaller than many Ive stayed in but that and the incredible customer service gives it a very intimate feel The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof which I really appreciated The hotel is literally a block from the beach The parking lot is small but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as wellThe staff was wonderful in particular Leonore and Terry They really took great care of us and I have to say its nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you It was my birthday while we were there and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day on my birthday they sent champagne and glassesWe also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated and I can not wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe The new rooms have an ultramodern San Francisco Asian theme to them and have all the amenities one could ask for especially if you are a technogeek like meOverall I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu,-1.9383857,3.3879323,0.15937805,2.0022833,-0.44203144,-0.5624198

290,22,5,My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki  my first time there and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel We would definitely stay there again As many others have already mentioned the staff is like none other Ive EVER met in a hotel We felt like family in just a few short days They even hugged us goodbye when we left Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile hello and answered many questions that we had about dining directions tips souvenir ideas sightseeing etc They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they would not all get eaten up during the continental breakfast We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms which is just lovely It has a modern asian look and feel to it Very beautiful I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer but things have been put on hold for now and theyre not sure yet when all the renovations will be done The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night At about  am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs They contacted all rooms by phone except for one and the security guard took care of the other room We slept like babies the rest of the time Leonor the manager made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there If youre unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay I can assure you youll be glad you stayed there Its only one block from the beach Its very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door  the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express We ate at both places twice they were that good and with very reasonable prices too Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view but we just ordered several appetizers The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck which also has an ocean view but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches For parking we kept our car at a garage about a block  away from the hotel for only day instead of day at the hotel You will not disappointed if you stay here,-6.79014,2.9581535,2.4707568,2.4202547,0.16181041,-0.1718671
291,22,5,We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our th anniversary trip to Oahu After reading several great reviews we chose Ocean TowerAfter having made the reservations on expediacom we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for oneWe arrived in Honolulu late after a long flight Check in for us was a breeze In just a minute we had our key cards We were well pleased with the room We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all Upon entering the room we were greated with a cool clean room We could not have been more pleased with our room The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top and a safe no extra chargeLeonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share She was very friendly as we chatted she asked what we were in Hawaii for We answered with it being our  year anniversary After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customersWe did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel It was a nice little set up with a toaster and bread peanut butter and jelly There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries The coffee was wonderful there was hot tea and also pineapple juice The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffinsGrace the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily she remembered my last name and we had not actually met She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed outThe location of the hotel was greatWe had an ocean view room even though we did not pay for one That was niceThe beach is a  minute walk and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shopsOver all our stay was a wonderful time for us We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool clean room to come back to and relax When it came time for us to check out Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us We were very touched Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too We really felt special This place is a people friendly place They treat each guest as though they were the most special I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my lifeIf you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach this is it This is the place to stay no matter what I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see  of these finished rooms WowThis hotel is probably going to go up to a  star ratingWhen we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower These are some special people and they are doing it right,-0.8048725,7.878783,3.4708428,1.6029439,0.17174715,-1.3814405

500,33,1,On my most recent work trip to NYC I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual The Peninsula Never again will I go back After a long day of client meetings I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar King Cole Bar I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew Id need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day Literally within  seconds of powering on my laptop one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after pm Seriously I had to ask myself was I really staying at a star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal He looked annoyed but then retreatedFast forward  minutesmy food and wine arrives and Im not even halfway through Thats when the FB manager then approaches me He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive Again to set the context I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting I am not engaging with anyone yet Im being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you do not go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop When I told him I did not understand their policy and why he was enforcing it he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene Unbelievable He then tells me hed be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work I am at this point just dumbfounded It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at whats supposed to be an upstanding hotel And just to be clear on the many occasions Ive had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave Crystal clear for me nowDear sfellelle On behalf of the Management team at The St Regis New York we would like to thank you for your visit We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our propertyOur hotel prides itself on providing five star service yet in some cases mistakes can occur We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department and please know that this is certainly not our standard Rest assured we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstancesWe most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future Please do not hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at Octaviamargineanstregiscom Sincerely Octavia MargineanHotel Manager,-4.4327965,5.9634867,5.4063725,2.7639956,-1.5698253,-0.67436653

506,33,3,I stayed in a huge tworoom suite here and I just do not understand the appeal Perhaps my tastes are just not ahem refined enough but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring This was the rd or th St Regis that Ive stayed at and I finally realized that the brand just is not for me I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels It was not a bad experience and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client but I would not stay here alone and I would not stay here for a romantic tripThe service was spectacular in the suite and included a private butler That said I do not really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming The hotel lobby is small and for my tastes uninteresting It lacks the wow factor The concierge was very good but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing Ive been to NYC more than  times but I always ask the basicsFor the money Id pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm sumptuous colors and textures in the larger rooms or even the Mandarin OrientalNote  I stayed in this hotel in Dear AllenThank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with usWe are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences but are glad to read that you enjoyed our teams service As far as our Concierge is concerned rest assured I will personally followup and use your feedback as a retraining opportunityWhen Mr John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in  on purpose they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as homelike as possible While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointedHopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your serviceHave a wonderful start of the new yearSincerelyDanielaOn behalf of The St Regis New York Team,-6.960098,3.8056157,3.3901048,4.1537156,0.14910576,-0.67571056

509,33,1,Stayed  night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service  hands down the worst received at any  luxury hotel On reserving the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons Accepting the higher rate charge on arrival there was no rollaway provided Luckily we did not want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member Checkin experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational Hotel would not honor the contractual onecategory if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program The hotels own website defines these room categories for sale superior deluxe grand luxe rooms then  bedroom suites Within the  bedroom suite category the room types are Astor Deluxe Madison Having booked a grand luxe room at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites The agent insisted their obligation was only a oneroom type upgrade and not a category upgrade which means any room type in that category Therefore as no Astor suite was available no upgrade for us I spoke to the Front Desk Manager Susan who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct Having now spent  mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it with nowhere offered for my family to sit I just wanted to get to a room I then called Amex who contacted the hotel Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth  extra and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade I do not appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx  more Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website  sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits On being shown to our room the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes One hour later no butler I page the butler and receive a call back requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities these were not provided even though child was listed on the reservation Another hour later still no sign of anything Page the butler again received the amenities never received the requested ice bucket Last we ever saw of the butler No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website but nice of them to provide tea cookiesmilk Ordered room service dinner with the still missing ice bucket  quality was very average for the price and beware families this hotel charges an  per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel So a family of  would pay a whopping  in addition to mandatory  gratuity and sales tax The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time Called for the traystrolley to be collected mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that  Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work Included complimentary breakfast worth  is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen consisting solely of  pastries coffee and one orange juice  On checkout the agents only words from walking to the desk were Mr  here is your bill let me correct this error hope to see you again No how was your stay or anything similarWhen paying four figures to stay in a hotel room this does not meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St RegisDear msnzPlease allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution We hope to be at your service again soon and until then please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may needKind RegardsHermann ElgerGeneral Manager,-5.2439165,5.1783924,5.111074,1.6239114,-0.66064554,-0.75267905

514,33,5,I loved this hotel It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way On checkin there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay Otherwise the whole stay was perfect The room was elegant It felt very classic and luxurious but also had any modern convenience The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast I would stay here again without hesitation We felt valued and specialDear johntillett Thank you so much for staying at The St Regis New York during your recent visit to New York CityWe are so grateful for your feedback and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor We hope to see you again soonSincerely Octavia MargineanHotel Manager,1.0799351,2.1301537,-0.37594375,2.1699426,-0.49970728,-1.2751769

516,33,3,The good First lets talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC Two blocks from Saks Museum of Modern Art and St Patricks Cathedral one block from Madison Ave three blocks from Central Park and the citys best restaurants within easy walking distance Everything is at your fingertips The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring  carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers all as you would expect and more The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning Hats off to the extraordinary designerThe rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers crystal chandeliers deep crown moldings luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks TV in the mirror deep soaker tub separate shower and Europeanstyle private flush The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished WiFi is included as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean All the staff are friendly from the doormen waiters maids valets etc We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection well prepared and quickly servedThe Bad Being an SPG member for  years with over  nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy It is something we have always received at all SPG properties  of the time since gaining Platinum status many many years ago We booked this trip six months in advance so it was not like they did not know we were coming We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec  they are useless to us now Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade She did not seem to understand the Platinum perks Talking with her was like talking to a wall so unlike other star hotels weve stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as  nights in one year alone with SPG He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since  when we met and had our very first trip together Of course when you do not get a suite you do not get the toiletries that go with it which Ive always loved at the St Regis I suppose I could have requested it but I did not We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holidayThe Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court We thought wed stay inhouse after long hours watching the Macys Parade Huge mistake Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with  tiny bar chairs We could not believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey Not even real turkey I could not understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner Now I know No one in their right mind would pay  USD for that miserable meal for two people I can not adequately describe our disappointment We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Years Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid We could not even eat the salads What kind of chef can not make a salad Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a  credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her I do not think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can not blame him Its a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a star dining room After visiting  other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just does not even make senseDear Katherine BThank you for taking the time to submit your

519,33,5,Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay My husband was just recently out of the hospital and still uses a walker We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave getting in and out of the car and walk up the stepsstairsIn stead of walking up the steps we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door Once we stepped into the lobby of St Rigis our worries went off the chimney There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel We sat comfortably awaiting for the checkingin Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine After a short wait we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready The idea that the management would do that for us has won us overSt Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty Once inside the room we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology among them the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the  types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquerlike Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience The huge multiplated mirrors which occupied the entire wall and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure The tub equipped with the hangover rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macys parade The marblestone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali so we were told when first were lead into our room I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers andor artists when we were greeted by the staff As we walked out of the room as we got in or out of the car we were greeted politely and warmly People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporationDear goplace We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly we thank you for making us your new favorite hotelSincerely Octavia Marginean,-3.8352718,6.197885,2.8700452,0.689811,0.8331672,-0.85495013

523,33,5,I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St Regis is starting to spoil me The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay Other hotels in NY are so small and the St Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms largerand nicer And it shows Fruit is delivered each night And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much work on the self control Luckily they had a great work out room open  hours and I used it every evening I cannot say enough good things about this hotel It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage The bottom line is if you get the chance stay here Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home The service is exceptional I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing as long as you do not mind the priceDear JD It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garmentOn behalf of the entire team at The St Regis New York we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor and we look forward to seeing you again soonWarmlyHermann ElgerGeneral Manager,-4.479818,1.6965755,0.22015595,2.5587046,-0.1586116,-0.63714045

527,33,5,We had not visited the St Regis Hotel in New York before and Ill admit to having been a little wary There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St Regis New York This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint fresh scrubbing fresh upholstery sparkling crystal and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms palatial by Manhattan apartment standards with a view of Fifth Avenue below Like the rest of the hotel the room was spotless freshly refurbished and offered two bathrooms a generous walkin closet a fridge and a host of creature comforts Could not have asked for betterThe Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we had not visited before Every phone call to room service the front desk and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful friendly and always helpful voice at the other end This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotels origins history and ambition to be the best at what it doesMinor gripes Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service a tradition and pride of the St Regis since its opening in  We found the service a little awkward to use When you phone the Butler you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine We were not sure what this was about so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers but shed make sure our request for coffee service got through A short while later the Butler did arrive with coffee and was very helpful with a few other requests But were not sure hed have shown if not for the operator because the next day we put in two calls and after waiting for over an hour for any response we just gave up and used other services We also found that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas the door staff was not its strong suit At great hotels the doormen are part of the guests first impression with a greeting an opened door and an offer of help The staff at least on our visit were often sort of just standing around in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experienceThe King Cole bar is cozy classically New York and historicfeeling The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hitandmiss Likewise the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay Again these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was overall perhaps the best hotel experience weve had in the US or Europe Congratulations to everyone at the St Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage propertyDear twinlions We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St Regis New YorkThank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests Also thank you for the constructive feedback regarding front service and butlers Rest assured it will be addressed We will share your kind words with our teams and we are so grateful for your supportWe hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soonSincerely Octavia MargineanHotel Manager,-4.8648596,2.9880433,1.5888171,3.121608,-0.0021354344,-0.84785765

601,38,4,Bad Nothing to dislike at all Good As a first time visitor to Chicago the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore Firstly the property services cleanliness wifi and staff were very good As mentioned by other users there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around  am Some may want a more sumptuous offering but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most Travelling to the hotel from OHare was simple If you can read and follow English signs its an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the  minute walk to the property Probably a better option to use taxis Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues As for food and entertainment the hotel is surrounded by excellent options Restaurants and bars of all types abound The House of Blues is right across the road for example River Walk is also a highlight and is only a  minute walk away The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis plus the first stop of Hop OnHop Off Bus tour company is  minutes away in front of the Trump Building As in other cities and countries that offer this service its an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place and Chicago is a stunning place to visit By the way Buddy Guys Legends Bar is well worth a visit People will always have various expectations but I found the staff service amenities and most of all the music on the night to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan this was a big tick on my personal bucket list The HOB was also great but did not have time to get down to Rosas Bar or Kingston Mines Ill leave that for the next timebut will be staying at the Kinzie,-1.2070397,2.3959472,-0.2152997,1.2229019,-0.24465992,-0.607182

623,38,2,Bad Overall I was very disappointed I rarely write reviews but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt For the cost Paid over night for lowest price person room  highly overpriced and overrated reviews I have to say I was attending last minute trip for work but wish I had chosen the Monaco Drake IntercontinentalHyatt Sheratonanywhere else For someone traveling on business I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree for four times the cost Freebies I did not have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfastsnacks in evening as I had to be out at other events which already provided this I did not need the free internet as I had my own Room Itself This was probably the worst aspect yet the most important and what prompted my very negative rating I overlooked a rusty building roof  wish I had taken a picture as I do not need gorgeous but this was anything but It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease I would have closed the blindsbut they were blackout blindswhich you do not want if waking up at  for work events The room was lackluster and though there are only  floors there are  VERY slow elevators one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay so do not try to get anywhere on time or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse Overall I expected more when I saw the cost positive ratings the reviews for boutique  this was anything but Disappointing stay especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday Will not be returning Good On the plus side the people at the front desk were fine  the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departurebut again not something that makes hotel stand out,-1.711673,3.756193,2.1212692,1.6881089,-0.947897,-0.31770325

810,50,2,I wish tripadvisor had  stars for our use because I would have given this a   is too high This was our first hotel of  different ones on our NapaPacific Coast vacation so I have a lot to compare it to I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property weve sayed atHaving said thatIt was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a nonplus oneI disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviewsthis is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have bettermore amenities or are closer to vineyards therefore its not a fair comparison Its like comparing apples and orangesboth fruits but there are many different qualities Now back to the propertyDo not expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants If thats what youre looking for great book it just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polutionConsThe pools capacity is  people That should tell you something about the size Id guess its X thats probably a generous estimate In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial The balcony we had was so closed in and dark The solid front and sides do not allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs not that the view was greatwe looked out over Dennys roof and a traffic light Oh Dennys sighwent our first  mornings Ordered the free entree of  eggs  pancakes and  bacon or sausage Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible the food was cold to the touch My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it There were maybe  other parties in the restaurant at the time not busy at all The tea water was luke warm at best Total waste of my timeLocationnot your romantic getaway place by any means About  to  minutes to the heart of Napas wine country depending on traffic In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY now suspicious in my mindreviews I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best Really After spending  days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries I question the validity of these raving reviewsProsYes there are a fewI promised a fair review and thats what I deliverShowerbest shower head of any hotel In fact Im looking for one for my own showerCleanlinessour room was very clean Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet Microwave fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenienceBedpillowsvery comfortableSo if youre looking for a clean place to sleep thats a bit overpriced than book this hotel If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pooldo not book this property At most I would expect to pay under  a night for this property based on its location and lack of amenities All the renovations in the world do not matter to me if theyre not available when Im there They need to charge accordinglyWe paid  for Saturday Sunday and Monday evenings I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property Oh well live and learnThank you for your detailed review First we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its

recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP property Improvement Plan in place With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines Our rates are similar to last years before Plus and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities We never hide the fact that we have a small pool x  There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other rd party sites When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger poolAs for reviews all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and oursThank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms we are an ultra clean property our shower heads and beds

851,51,4,We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter With that being said we are happy with our choice When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great We got to our room on the th floor and were happy with the amenities The room was not as large as I would have thought but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room There was a coffee pot a mini fridge and lots of mirror space Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area pretty cool The beds are comfortable and the towels did not feel like sandpaper They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine however I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner allinone which I did not care for but my husband loved The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup applicationThe lobby area is very nice and fun They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there premade salads sandwiches candy chips fruit yogurt beer juice pop etc The lobby bar is very nice good drinks and a fun environment Lots of games and fun dcor LaKisha I hope I spelled that right was very friendly and did a great job They do offer a pool table and computersprinter which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room The bed was always made toiletries and towels were always replaced however that was about it No trash was picked up and nothing was organized When you go to a hotel typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the roombathroomvanity completely but this was not the case Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away the coffee pot was not put back or the coffee replenished but new coffee cups were given whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it there was a bottle cap left on the floor small things that added up This was not huge issue but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out Also the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor but that was not a huge deal just oddOur friends who were staying on the th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water however we did notThe hotel is in a good location two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon easy walking The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient All in all the hotel was a great choice and wed recommend and stay there again For being brand new they did a great jobFantastic Thank you for your feedback with us being a new property reviewers like yourself help us get better We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Refuel pantry We cant wait to have you back here with us again soonWe truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola Dixie Krauss Operations Manager,-2.2362328,8.469594,6.4465528,-0.4138473,-0.7880099,-1.0822849

976,70,1,We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel Im generally a  star reviewer of hotels with the occasional  star here and on Trip Advisor but this was my worst experience There are plenty of problems with this place but Ill start with the prosPro Location to  Flags and room comfort Both of these and parking were fineCons It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience Ive ever had and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that From walking into the hotel to checkin to finally walking into my room was probably  minutes and when you are traveling with family its late at night and you have to get up early thats  minutes you can use I walked in to the hotel and I was probably rd or th to check in and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems I do not know what the other customer issues were but they were not the problems By the time I got there I could see why it took a long time A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else When I did finally get my room keys I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG and the keys do not work and yes Ive stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards So after trying for several minutes I go back down to front desk wait in line for about  more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins and have the worker re key the cards again and this time I watched to make sure he did them and they did work when I returned to roomIn my room I check the safe and on the safe it has the note about if you do not want to be billed for not using the safe tell front desk on check out So the next morning I tell front desk we did not use the safe and yet he still put it on my bill and would not removeAnd this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue They are not checking on their hotels at all This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website but it is a problemOn the rd floor the elevator has only  button since you can only go down but the arrow points up little thing that make no difference on my stay but demonstrate lack of care The privacy door latch was put up backwards so that it could not do anything to keep someone from opening the door These lack of attention to details is not a big thing by themselves but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparentDear Guest I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests but unfortunately sometimes we do fail I will look into each issue that you have noted in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies Sincerely Hotel Manager,-0.4334312,7.265064,5.0131087,1.5564816,-1.5895829,-0.9701726

1065,85,4,I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons  It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim as it was a Category  for points redemption while the others were at least a Category  It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee  Free continental breakfast I tend to be pretty cost conscious so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food pricesI still had a few doubts but I went into the stay with an open mind and was not disappointed My biggest concern the location in relation to Disneyland ended up being a nonissue The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than  minutes At a cost of only  for a threeday pass it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well Even though the hotel is not within walking distance of Disneyland I would not hesitate to book again The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel The room itself was more than adequate The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suitestyle hotels I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small Everything was nice and clean no complaints thereI see that someone else complained about the breakfast but I think it was as good as should be expected for free I have seen fancier but during my stay the breakfast included cereal  types bagels English muffins yogurt fresh whole fruit instant oatmeal and boxes of raisins quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down as am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after allMy only other complaint would be the toilet paper I do not necessarily expect the nicest paper out there but the stuff in my room was the roughest singleply toilet paper Ive ever seen I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel could not spend a little more for a decent twoply Overall I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games although I may encourage them to bring their own TP,-10.7606,-1.500863,2.5799944,5.231866,0.2454452,1.2736869

1072,85,1,We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the st weekend in JanWe never have issues but when it rains it pours with this groupWe checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a rerate They changed the name on the reservation they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from  to  We booked in Oct but st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodelbut the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck There was  or  couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lotOur st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess floorboards missing walls messed up the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etcIt was late about  and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other buildingWe do and its a bigger mess then the st building There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too the nd building is oldsmells and needs remodel bad The new room is  bedroom but its hit and miss way to much furniture kitchen is dated microwave falling down dusty and dirty and about a  gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wantedWhen we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel We book next time at HiltonWas really disappointed that management did not reach out to us in till we contacted themJohn Dominguez Assistant GM uselessThank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property however we always have a manager on dutyAs we are currently undergoing renovations we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stayIm happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room We are sorry that you declined it My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining  accessible rooms were fully committed The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dollys that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving As we placed you in an unrenovated suite for the final part of your stay I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident while isolated is unacceptable We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that As you have stated you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issuesThe room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium,-4.482359,4.122982,2.7572458,2.400497,-0.28175095,-0.1363895
1073,85,4,We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row It was the perfect location It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant The Catch I think The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast Its always convenient when traveling with kids There was barely any room to sit and very busy One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful The pool area is small but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours It was a nice temperature not too cold They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi The room slept  of us but was not spacious It was nice to have the  queens in separate bedrooms and a living area so if someone wanted to rest they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room There were  TVs The beds were OK The bathroom was small considering the room slept  people not  adults but doable with a mixture of adults and kids The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you prepare it and not eat out every meal The decor is updated but some areas of the room felt worn The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front deskHello SnulieThank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott It is candid reviews like yours that allow us to continually look at ways to make guests stay more comfortable and relaxing I have mentioned your comments to the appropriate department managers and we are brainstorming ways to review your areas of concern We are delighted to serve you again if your travel needs bring you back to the Orange County area Thanks againWarmest Regards,-2.4850314,4.5930142,1.8715535,3.3441603,-0.38546288,-1.1601893
1074,85,3,HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for   days from Wednesday to Friday During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel which according to him was about  yards away from the office However the second night was fully booked The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a  minute walk Ive walk from this hotel to the office The walking time was a lot less then  minutes I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away The room I stayed in was a studio suite which included a kitchen There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen Twice at night around PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that days work The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast The breakfast is buffet style with pastry bread coffee eggs and sausage Both times Ive had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold I do not mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee However if there is hot cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages should not be stale Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business tripWe are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim It wastruly a pleasure to serve youWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like youThank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to AnaheimSincerelyEdgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgarriveramarriottcom,-6.3894362,2.3218188,2.2290251,4.2723575,-0.5087182,-0.37366578

1088,85,3,We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland The good  bedroom suite was very large The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge Great workingdesk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator small stove microwave etc Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice The staff was great helpful and friendly Location was great lots of stuff nearby on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways Breakfast was small but a decent selection  the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room The bad some parts of the hotel have not been renovated so there is a mix of newnice and oldrun down in the same room ie bathroom counters were nice but the rest of the bathroom was dated Old dresser in the bedroom but tvs were nicer The carpeting was old and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area For having a large living space there was not a lot of seating So there was a small sofabed and a table with just one chair It would be nice to have the table and  chairs so that if multiple people are in the room a standard family there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit  people the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a  hold for incidentals on my credit card the system automatically puts a hold for  for each night of your stay unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system I did not know this until i looked online at my credit card account Fortunately Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the nd night Still though unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account Ive never had that happen at any other marriott property I also had trouble connecting to the wifi it kept giving me an error that I could not log into the wifi with my room number and last name But it actually still connected me on all devices I tried so I just ignored the error and it worked just fineMartha CThank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate We appreciate your kind words regarding your satisfaction with the friendly staff amenities in the room and overall location of the hotel We pride ourselves on being able to provide you with a wonderful experience and we are happy to hear that you would return to the property on your future visits to Orange CountyI apologize that you experienced a few issues during your stay but am glad to see that we were able to resolve those during the few days you were visiting with us Thank you for giving us the opportunity to WOW you in the future and please feel free to contact me directly if you have any further questions or concernsAdam,-2.7531178,5.627033,2.754961,1.7055439,-0.37916946,-0.9206547

1309,122,2,We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother We stayed at the Hyatt House The staff was friendly but not very empowered Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior We missed having a window to do a quick weather check The bathroom was spacious but had the most nonergonomic faucet Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop Although sometimes things happen it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment The free shuttle will take you up to  mile away if it is available or you can wait The breakfast buffet was good but they did not always restock items including coffee lids in a timely fashion I do not recommend this hotel,-4.6499815,1.2205489,0.5102187,0.6950284,-0.06924902,-0.09900879

1312,122,5,My plans to use my  free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle I did not have a choice As it turns out I made an excellent choice Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful Check in was straightforward and easy with the best service ever but more on that later Once we were moved by request out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room we were absolutely delighted with our stay The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities We loved the location literally across the street from the Space Needle The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled  degree view of the city The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern like a boutique hotel The bed was very comfortable firm but not hard A very minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread which was a bit rough to the touch but the sheets were crisp and smooth Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking but the rain shower turned out to be fine lots of space in shower could use a seat or shelf for sitting Lots of storage space as well as hangers if you are staying a few days and want to unpack The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I do not understand The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning he only thing that was not perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving but for some reason our room was skipped Its always nice to come home to a freshenedup room and a made bed We had enough towels to get us through so it was fine especially given that everything else was so good Saving the best part for last let me say that more than anything I have described what we liked most by far about our stay at Hyatt House was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk Everyone at the front desk was truly great but she was a shining star Im not sure Ive ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel Thanks to her this was a perfect weekend getaway,-4.2715797,5.8486304,3.3532653,0.7732964,0.5917506,-0.5323242

1336,122,5,If youre not a Seattle veteran you need to know that there are  main downtown neighborhoods The old city by Pioneer Square in the south the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center Space Needle While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation Personally for tourist purposes I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much  primarily because its a little less corporate a little more casual and has ready access to many of the best museums like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt Its also only a  minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House and they offer a complimentary shuttle service tooIn this context the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if youre OK with the Seattle Center location The hotel is new and has a nice modern vibe Since its an extended stay brand rooms at the Hyatt House are large For this particular location they also made them stylish As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable onebedroom suite facing the Space Needle Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette the buffet food had no delays Its a nice touch to offer omelettes but it does not work unless they can be made efficientlyThe shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing In rush hour traffic the service can be quite slow Id recommend walking to downtown during peak periodsDavesreviewsThank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guestSarah Junge,-4.789833,2.4715214,2.113662,2.3236048,-0.6424218,-0.87544584

1366,124,4,If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miamistyle vibe in a central location this might be the place for you The hotel is located right on the main drag Duval street so its close to restaurants drugstores bars etc You can walk to everything from the hotel The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night After having difficulty sleeping the first night noise until about  am we asked to moved the next morning the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice for example Oh Im sorry the noise kept you up That was not the case The response was At least youre not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice The hotel staff was finecordialbut not friendly or terribly accommodating The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else The bikes on the property were GREAT We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar Overall we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay,-1.7970947,2.636347,-0.6094377,1.782888,0.06565177,-1.0179148

1368,124,5,A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new whiteclad room property located steps from Duval Street the main drag in Key West Staff seem a bit overtaxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals room service taxis and logistics Service was excellent starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo who is helpful not to mention easy on the eyes Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents Blue lighting predominates on the exterior too Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lapstyle pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end Careful  they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable and was part of the new remodelconstruction You may want to request a newer room The location cannot be beat It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street Through a side gate you step right onto Duval Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days Go right and there are more of the same including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only  to  blocks away I walked to the marina for several excursions to the southernmost point and south beaches The hotel has bikes available at no charge I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and faroff marinas for some of my excursions Overall this property served me well Its common spaces are chic and modern the rooms are comfortable and the people working there make things as easy as possibleThank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated Please come back and see us,-1.7568066,4.6608496,0.80019975,2.2146864,-0.13676693,-1.2166911

1370,124,4,First off Ill start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they are not wrong My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx  square feet That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done but youd never want to stay in it more then a night or two They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was  room away from ours and on NYs Eve they had their party on it  I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NYs but Ive never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who were not attending their NYs party All and all Id say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs this was not cheap at  per night for  for the smallest room that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the  dollars a person they made at the NYs partyI apologize for the noise on New Years Eve Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island We hope you will give us another visit on a nonholiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you Happy New Year to you and your family,-2.3435488,5.831197,2.1118395,2.9298894,0.10957085,-0.9413701
1371,124,5,My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies However our room was spotlessly clean overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue The staff was very accommodating and interesting The location is centrally located and convenient This is not a cookie cutter hotel There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it If youre looking for something unusual this is it Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to MarriottWe do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectationsAs a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and designWe hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future,-0.87026167,1.0472723,-0.89875674,1.3350171,-0.28115934,-0.726263
1372,124,5,This property was delightful in every way  the perfect place to celebrate my birthday The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable functional and stylish The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay particularly given the proximity to Duval Street Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing each in his own way They are artists behind the bar brewing literally sometimes concoctions that are different from anything Ive ever tasted but each was really special And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in  courses and they were nothing short of magnificent Again like nothing Ive ever had before I LOVE this place and will undoubtedly be back again hopefully before too longThank you so much for your review we are so delighted your birthday was a success It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite Its good to know weve made a new friend hope to see you again soon,0.38236734,3.9429755,0.82379425,0.55103695,-0.0012731128,-1.8751128
1373,124,1,What a bad mistake choosing this hotel As a Platinum Marriott member I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation Man was I wrong Although I booked the least expensive room type I expected a room upgrade if available The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available but the hotel refused to upgrade I have never seen this before The manager lied to me saying there were no other rooms available and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experiencedmy home closet is larger Worse yet the room did not feel clean The bathroom floor was unacceptable Thankfully I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less In sum ridiculously small unclean room with horrible managementThank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again Cheers,-5.7829475,3.044805,2.715802,2.8512232,-0.60593647,-0.5109645

1375,124,4,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently The room was beautiful the staff very friendly and helpful We loved the balcony overlooking the pool We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day but the staff were quick to bring them to us We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers We thought the location was perfect and the bikes were a treat also We did lose WiFi Tv and music due to some sort of work going on in the street It all came back on after a while We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again Jim Lois HoganMr Mrs Hogan thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms location and staff I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment Should you travel to Key West in the near future we hope you will consider The Saint Hotel Key West as your next residence Thank You once again,-3.8340669,2.6440392,0.47174537,2.5098233,-0.14999121,-0.75109214

1377,125,3,We recently stayed at the Suncoast Hotel for a wedding we attended This hotel was chosen by the couple so we were not sure what to expect The staff was pleasant enough Upon entering we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke much stronger than any other casino weve ever been in Our room was spacious enough and clean though dated somewhat in appearance The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay but we did not bother to call about it The price of course is ridiculously low My husband and I are not big gamblers so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino There is a TGI Fridays near the pool which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times The food and service there was very good There is a bar by the pool but it was not open at all during our  day stay This property is a good  minute ride from the strip which is about a  cab ride one way For us personally we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well,0.648571,3.0915735,-1.3543409,0.57360905,0.62562627,-0.2222955
1378,125,3,I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week Their deluxe rooms are sub par the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us All of the rooms are spacious but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable We never stayed in the one bedroom suite but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite one of four in the hotel room  We were booked in the Med suite but decided to accept the upsell upgrade and pay the extra  per night to check it out While it is about  sq ft larger than the Med the huge common area was wasted on the two of us The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox I must comment about their toiletries The showerbath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap but the kicker was the handface soap It was a little round disc in a plastic package When I opened it to use it I thought it was a recycled soap piece It had no lather and was just crap If anyone from the property reads this you really need to rethink these products as they scream CHEAP The rest of the facility is a midstream casinoresort experience Granted you are not on the Strip but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent The Deli offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we did not try The pool appears to be small for the property so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking Overall not a bad place but just OKThank you for posting your comments on your recent stay I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer Have a nice day,-3.0956988,3.0724177,1.2789956,2.0418606,-0.558884,0.0056966525

1386,125,3,Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays almost double the workweek day rate  and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas some more than others Flights expensive from the East Coast this year Saturday return some  cheaper than flying back on Sunday  and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover timeThe next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl airport  its apprx  miles in distance taxicab  when arriving late night But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose  thers a lowkey bus WestCliff Express for two  dollars that takes about  minutes while still running along the highways and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter milem from the hotel entrance Other participants of the convention took out rental cars the hotel shuttle price not known last leaves hotel or airport by pm so youre out of luck on eastbound red eye flights thats where the bus really pulls its weightEnormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke  almost like good ole Europe used to be The area appears more cluttered efficiently equipped with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area at firstYes the personnel really is friendlier here than in town instead of the allocated room on the third floor I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains Clean room with separate sink area vs showertoilet area albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the s than the s A flat screen TV not HDwith a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning and I could not turn it off at the end of a two night stay not via remote or on the mainframe The biggest drawback were the enormous  AC motors below the size of B engines and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running  mind we had F C outside temps during the dayToo bad despite the weekend room rate surcharge wifi was available only at another surcharge of day and amazingly I managed without No group discount considering the conference had been negotiatedA very opulent breakfast bar greets the allnighter not before am on weekends keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you  meal discount but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas the quantity or the quality Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet good job guys Please tip the friendly staff like EasternersA solid good not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor near the bingo hal with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel is not latest generation any moreWould I recommend it heatsoaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here its not close to the strip but if you do not need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious this might just be your choice for a few days Good luck in winning a jackpot,-1.8579006,5.5857344,3.7410867,1.2241709,-0.9035463,-1.3178986

1424,125,5,I can not say enough about the Suncoast My brother lives in Las Vegas so as far as the Strip  we have been there done that If you are a first time visitor then by all means stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon no traffic and great value  then consider a stay at the Suncoast We my husband myself and two children have stayed there  times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit You can not beat the low room rates and the rooms are HUGE and very nice The hotel has a large casino friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants midrange restaurants even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded There is a movie theater and bowling alley They also have a nightclub and on several occasions my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both showsThe only downside is the distance from the Strip  which is probably a  minute cab ride But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens which also has some nice restaurants If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon do some hiking or horseback riding or play golf this would be a great place to stay We have never had a bad time at Suncoast,-4.2194724,4.5253134,1.325034,2.305782,1.1152372,-0.8139217

1430,125,3,I just got back from my  night stay here at the SunCoast hotel I have to say that rooms are spacious nice and very clean Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well On the other hand costumer service is very badFront desk staff is horrible At some point there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about  minutes did not even look up once One afternoon I tried to order room service at around  and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there was not anyone to take my order at the moment So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant At the restaurant the staff was welcoming They seated us quickly But their attention to detail was missing I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided At the check out a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone Yeah Thats what Im doing Might not sound like a bad response but its the way the person says it that has a bad effect When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel Which it is but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people Hello Angy FThank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback At Suncoast we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate It is disappointing to learn that we were unsuccessful in meeting these high standards during your time with us and I am sorry that it caused you to have less than a five star visit Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported Again I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments,-6.1690106,2.51121,1.8785541,4.12875,-0.68947655,0.08043835

1453,128,4,Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel The location alone makes this hotel worth it Its located right by the Chicago river  block from the Magnificent Mile There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotelThe rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wantedMaid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requestedBella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza thereMy only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive Its well hidden If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far As well when checking in we had reserved  rooms and they were showing a record of only  rooms They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time Once we were given our rooms we were told we had  rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair Unfortunatly  of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible They did have a secured area on the rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the cityAll in all a great expericen for the price,-0.9084993,3.3814566,1.1170534,0.47482675,-0.7656627,-1.0109224

1457,128,1,So this hotel is pretty nice to look at and the staff was very friendly however we entered the room very small and continued to look at the room We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean however in the box spring of the bed there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotelGuest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity If necessary our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technologyI encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at   RespectfullyAnna HampsonHotel Manager  River Hotel,-5.097664,-0.391292,0.24812475,2.6438284,-0.11780998,-0.66294277
1458,128,1,I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons They do not honor their commitments I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia but was given a room with two twin beds instead The excuse they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds how lame is that  The elevator was unreliable After checking in myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning cardreader in the elevator The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving Not a good sign The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room  The staff have no concept of customer service On a prior visit the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout even  minutes after the official checkout time  truly Kafkaesque At checkout no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay Overall the location is great the rooms are clean and quiet and all of the appliances work But expect to be treated like a thirdclass citizen if you stay here,2.718598,0.7570575,-0.8902498,0.91517013,-0.6048657,-0.43448073
1459,128,4,We stayed in a small queen room for  nights The room is small but comfortable I will say however that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable The sheets have a papery feel to them as well But the pillows are fluffy Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like youre sleeping on clouds but it does the trick I suppose Still all in all the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if youll be spending time downtown The room is quiet and the wifi is free Its also affordable Based on that I recommend itDear Ann CThank you for your recommendation We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experienceWe look forward to welcoming you back in the future,9.081949,1.809193,-0.45577016,2.0677114,-0.125081,-0.025500283

628,129,3,My complaint is that after you check in they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting And hey if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting more power to you I do not And I tried to be polite about it because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I was not interested And the first lady seemed cool about it Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting I still said no She proceeded to get really patronizing By the fifth time Im saying no I start to not feel so polite And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting I just had no patience for it I loved the room I loved the size and the cleanliness I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting I did not pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share If it had not been for that Id have had no problem being a repeat customer I do not like being pressured into something I say no to And now a month later I just got a call from the hotel group again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting Luckily the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once,-1.182458,6.199224,3.990146,0.7580044,-1.5831567,-0.2431496

29,406,2,My daughter and I stayed for one night I checked in around  PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub There was maybe X floor space in the bathroom itself The bed was extremely soft,-4.6035314,3.8684115,1.6631217,1.0462929,0.96925044,-0.36051115

29,428,4,We enjoyed our stay at this establishment The king size room was very comfortable the bedding and mattress type in particular One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion major kudos Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed on second day of  night stay and although the request was eagerly granted the bed linen was not changed Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed The service desk accommodated us as best as they could at p but our sheets did not get changed until a when the overnight attendant came on duty This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel Thank You,-1.1644866,0.5029269,-0.46140838,1.0000273,-0.8813294,-0.43418178

29,428,5,We booked in here due to an early morning flight It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it Very lovely clean room and the staff were very helpful and polite The only downside was upon checking out the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late and due to the amount of people and luggage was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttlehowever the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out,-0.24103421,5.503943,1.597761,-1.374758,0.325392,-0.32840857
2405,428,3,The point of us staying at this hotel was to have safe parking and use their shuttle service to get us to light rail and into the city The shuttle only was available every half hour and was full most of the time We still ended up having to drive into the inner harbor and pay for parking Not to mention that the hotel booked  wedding on one day All of the wedding guests parked in the parking lot of the Hilton as well as the adjacent hotel and we circled for hours trying to find parking to no avail We had to park down the street and hope we did not get towed I had gone to the front desk to alert them of the issue They could not be bothered with my issue However other guests stated that they were offered free valet but then had to tip for the service Definitely not worth the price considering its no better than a Hampton Inn or something similar in a lower price range Some of the desk personnel were lovely to deal with but one in particular was irritated if you spoke to her,5.21747,3.0743678,0.5781476,0.13748433,-1.1807381,0.003123356

29,499,2,Terribly managed hotel Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do  listening to their phone conversation with apparently their manager it seems they had a number of free rooms  but those had not been cleaned and where dirty They also made everyone pay a  security fee  which upset several of the guests trying to check in My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem However I needed to go three times up to my room on the th floor because the key card did not work  they then switched me to another room The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in Since they could give me another room why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant To sum it up I do not recommend this hotel Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead  eventhoug it is a little more expensive Other folks in my group stayed there  I should have done the same,0.72059023,6.082724,2.674544,0.28676027,-1.0406076,-0.25816724

29,499,3,The hotel was generally clean well maintained comfortable beds towels at poolside breakfast buffet reasonably stocked However there were a couple of problems with our room We stayed in room  for two nights First when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes However upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away Additionally paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later even though the air conditioner was on the whole time Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine and I wouldnt have suspected any problem However my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged or both I looked for a recirculate control on the AC but couldnt find one Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room though I saw no sign of it I reported this to the clerk on checkout The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly so it was impossible to take a tub bath The clerk offered to switch our room but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon,-9.1338625,-0.4209481,2.2575338,2.9057646,0.0487977,0.7862379

29,499,4,For being located in the city of D C the price was reasonable My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member Of course they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do whats right I should have been able to receive this discount but the computers would not allow it This is wrong In the past before modern technology they would have done this While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an override for him because he did not pay yet Im not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back,-4.699917,1.0589294,1.9655633,1.8410916,-1.4289706,0.48180172

29,587,1,Other than the staff this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved they had not Both my sister and I received several bug bites Hoterl staff was nonesistent We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area the toilet overflowed the first time we used it And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands ewww Now on to the facilities The levator was out of order one night unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area We were subjected to splashes in our face yelling and our belongings being knocked over staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained We spent a total of a half hour of our  day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her faceAugust in Virgina is hot as Hades and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead To reiterate the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific DO NOT STAY HERE,-3.335302,4.175576,2.6070366,0.6724899,-0.45861718,-1.111237

29,587,5,This appeared to be a brand new hotel It is extremely clean bright and modern They have a guest laundry on the rd floor that you can do yourelf It costs  to wash and also to dry The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room so I had to make a trip downstairs for that They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free That was great to check emails print out maps etc The breakfast there is included but ends at  am which for vacationing families seemed very early The breakfast was OK but the same every day The lobby is great you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area The workout room was very nice It was large and actually had free weights not just the usual treadmill My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it When you first walk in the pool area it feels like a sauna but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet The location is right off  and it took us only about  minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot You can walk there The rooms are huge plenty of room for a family to spread out The furnishings are very pretty artwork lamps curtains They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators which are very large as well Overall this place was great,-0.25178888,3.9156692,-0.7810759,0.7313006,0.8080941,-0.116615765

29,595,3,We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available  however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry The other issue was with the shower The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than  inch of water in the tub To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off I know these seem like small first world problems but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality,-6.3650274,1.5495046,1.2562697,2.3842053,0.003937966,0.3105049

68,598,5,My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway The hotel is small but the rooms are big There were a lot of mirrors and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready We were on the second floor so the noise from the street was pretty loud but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night The breakfast is a pseudohot breakfast no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker Location is perfect but at night it gets loud and rowdy and there was some police activity just a block down nothing bad just drunken party goers I would definitely stay here again,2.3761861,1.045014,-1.7045232,1.242887,-0.17704596,-0.29621023
29,598,2,The staff was great especially the valet The room had no sound proof Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything We were on the th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day The worst was the tub though You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it,-2.741056,2.1453142,0.6809695,-0.70157146,0.12449063,0.6980693

29,598,3,For the most part we enjoyed our stay We thought our room was much bigger as thats how it seemed advertised online and we also thought the lobby area would be bigger We got stuck on the elevator had to pull the doors open ourselves to exit the elevator on the morning after our first nights stay The staff was not very communicative about the elevator issues and did not really provide any real direction about updates or ways to return to our rooms using another means other than the elevator,-3.7625868,2.386207,0.9946217,0.9708387,-0.5758124,0.48391283

29,598,2,I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean I found a dried up contact lense in our bed there was mildew in the tub and the room could have used a sweeping The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel Last I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I do not think we will be staying here again,0.8079617,5.0993085,0.661747,1.0344348,-0.08575503,-0.62358207

29,598,5,I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room Out of the  days that I stayed there I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom I was short on towels soap and shower gel I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review,-3.5067713,0.4684727,0.56114084,0.79890496,-0.10188663,-0.40278664

29,611,3,Having travelled over the past  months this hotel for a  star location was very disappointing First the decor is very old dark and noninviting Secondly the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area plenty of restaurants to choose from However on your way from the airport to the hotel you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby They offer transportation to the Mall  approx mi track for  Obviously not customerfriendly They infer that the transportation is to be free Also upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken they sheepishly responded Wedo not have anything like that The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out After a  min return the orange juice was still out at  AM Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel The food was decent but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers were not trying tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar Finally there are no internet instructions posted in the room,2.3049023,2.5722215,-0.17222363,0.48904443,-0.81754357,-0.2982871

411,611,5,I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely due to her falling sick with food poisoning The hotel was clean comfortable and had a nice breakfast area People have complained that it is small which it is but breakfast can be taken back to your room which I preferred There is a computerprinter available to print out ticketsboarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an onlineonly deal We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once on the first night and found it really nice It was during a Karaoke night so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent although I did not sing I wish Id booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast and I already want to go back I would book here again although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis its a good  minute drive each way but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall and some other amenities such as the Airport,3.9100115,2.619542,-1.175198,0.79301,-0.9314527,0.27665004

66,611,2,There was an old musty smell in the room and the internet did not work we could only pick up wifi in the hallway These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list but what tops it off is the poor service The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay At check in we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting we got there at  and it ends at  but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was  they would not restock Normally I would not have a problem with that policy but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally seconds earlier it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold Ultimately if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck it may work for you but do not expect too much in regards to customer service On the other hand if you can afford the extra  dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere I am will not return to this hotel,1.3338591,3.4564378,-0.78355247,1.2366875,-0.08161254,-0.514236

29,613,3,Our experiences with the staff at the hotel were great everyone was very friendly The room itself was okay Nothing very exciting but it had what we needed It felt a bit worn out There was a crack in the shower wall The safe in the room was quite hard to open because the lock itself was worn The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason the AC was very loud but it did keep us nice cool The pillows on the bed were strange instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow about  on a bed they were very thick roundish Too hard on the neck The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning The breakfast bar included juices tea coffee milk There was cereal French toast grits sausage eggs pastries fruit yogurt toast English muffins etc You will not go away hungry The indoor pool was like a sauna A bit too warm for us The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool It is in walking distance of shops restaurants Its also about an hour away from Busch Gardens There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called Sweet Frog Awesome but a bit on the expensive side A great treat though The best thing is the beach so it is well worth it to get an Oceanside balcony,1.0186654,3.613935,-1.1623082,1.1146066,0.04178938,0.24121092

29,617,4,After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle Unfortunately I did not listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks and I missed it Moral of the story do not assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up After that The shuttle worked very well In the room the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy The breakfast was very good and the staff was friendly,-1.8066925,3.2367845,0.8362395,-0.34323654,-0.06317532,-0.691869

29,617,3,It is true that you get what you pay for the hotel staff was very friendly but the first issue was with the AC  the hallways are like a oven they only have  window AC units on each end of the hallways when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna  very uncomfortable the water pressure is very poor it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling the drain in the bath tub was plug need to call maintenance to fix it and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis bacon or sausage on my  days stay not even one day the meat appeared I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE,4.138217,-0.28347722,-1.5304495,0.6747427,-0.8928323,0.7690449

3701,617,4,The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as comfortable rooms and breakfast Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for  dollars a person We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area as well as my wife expecting our first baby She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we did not want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him he hung up on us and a police officer and shut off his phone We did not get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized We did get half of our money back from the second driverboss of the company When returning to the hotel the staff did not seem concerned with the mishap I do not think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel,-1.1165931,2.2964664,0.8549501,0.8953857,-1.1399525,-0.53575563

3703,617,4,Visited DC for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from Breakfast was oknot that much variety but for the price adequate Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at  pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away Front desk just said sorry we cant waitnext shuttle will be in  minutes We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well Overall a good place to stay I would recommend it to friends,-1.1230757,1.2033024,-0.9844321,1.1366944,-0.59616375,0.44605342

29,621,4,I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel Its a little difficult to get to if you do not know the area but its very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown it would probably be a nice walk in the springsummer I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean There was a flat screen tv and couch A bit uncomfortable though The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets The bathroom was clean but a bit small There is a lot of storage and a large closet so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time The staff was very attentive and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work though Im sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk the small bathroom and the fact that you have to pay for parking  a night Other than that I definitey recommend this hotel,2.2478828,2.3378005,-0.40143436,0.7538195,-0.8993532,-0.42968076

29,621,5,My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for  days in October Overall it was a very enjoyable stay The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub it was in another room however and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it The hotel setting is lovely  just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suites compact kitchen There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station which is walkable in a pinch and will take you to the grocery store as well The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington,0.21682698,0.5800147,-1.4959847,1.3129908,-0.2420071,-0.31502238

346,621,3,My recent three day stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington was pleasant enough but it could have been so much better if the facility was simply updated with some relatively minor interior design modifications that would give it a fresh  look Adding some color to the walls fabrics finishes and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact The location was great in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlingtons riverfront the downtown commercial center the METRO station and the Key Bridge and Georgetown The hotel is located on  mile from Interstate  so vehicular access was great The beds were very comfortable but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized Overall it was a very nice place to sleep and I would stay there again especially if cost were an issue,-0.6510206,1.9188809,-0.6835105,1.6102451,-0.03406122,-0.80174893

4435,829,5,My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston I usually stay at Marriotts or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express We were pleasantly surprised This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated The lobby was beautifully done as were the rooms and breakfast areas The staff all seemed eager to help and please The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruiseThe free breakfast was also a bonus as it was not your usual boring continental breakfast offerings They had different items on each of the mornings we were there Some were Omelettes sausage biscuits bacon and warm cinnamon buns The coffee was great and I am fussy with my coffee and they even had a pancake machineWhile the location was not right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel We did not use the car instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time,-2.999046,5.816219,2.4475412,0.9811055,0.09226665,-0.6932756

4898,956,3,I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so First the hotel is beautiful Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer Rooms are a bit pricey but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville In fact Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that too was a great location site It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom I would not have anything negative to say about it I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotels event planner While she sets up everything for you or instructs the staff Im not entirely sure I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided Also my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception The hotels planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items The hotels planner is not consistently present during the reception especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel She is present only here and there but not consistently We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotels planner or anyone to help Overall the hotels planner was useful in organizing the details planning food etc She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be At times communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed The overall package price in my opinion was helpful Next we had issues with the clean up of the event which is part of the package The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor which resulted in my DOC father and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my fathers room As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception there was no one to talk to about what was happening Needless to say the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride After some pressing to the Westin compensation was given for this I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing For reception food it was fantastic We had many compliments on the steak sides etc The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric Eric is a jack of all trades  he was the bartender at the rehearsal bell hop at various points waiter at the reception van driver on Sunday If you have Eric doing anything you are in good hands We also had a fantastic server JJ at the wedding  we loved her too The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver In the end this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar You are charged taxes gratuity and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package this was an issue and Im still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned Think twice about this option Most of our decor was returned  a few items were missing,-4.8525414,6.7873063,5.2751255,2.5236468,-0.37631267,-0.98364294

199,1053,4,The Mills House is a very old hotel in Charleston that has been nicely updated to the modern age It is really close to just about everything If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends Except for the cost however we found little to complain about The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet My only complaint was that the breakfast though good was nothing special,4.7113047,3.046865,-0.29950058,0.83573425,-0.2594318,-0.049233615
